title: Linear Regression Modelling!
---

As part of a Data Science bootcamp capstone project at BrainStation, my cohort is tasked to choose a project to work on and apply the techniques learned in class to our chosen problem. I chose to tackle my capstone project using Linear Regression models, which - for better or worse - was a steep learning curve because the bootcamp does not go too in-depth with these models as they are relatively simple.
